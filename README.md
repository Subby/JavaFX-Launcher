JavaFX Launcher
=========

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/cV3GV2p.png)

I created this launcher for a client. The requirements fulfilled were as following:

* A logo displayed with a dark background
* Buttons to open a JAR application and URLs
* Window with a custom icon

Setup
----

To get the "Play" button to work put a jar file named "play.jar" in the following directory:

```
src/resources/
```

Notes
----

The application uses the [Desktop API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Desktop.html). There might be some functionality issues on some operating systems.
